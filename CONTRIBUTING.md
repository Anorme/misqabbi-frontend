<body (optional)>
```

### Common Commit Types

- feat – New feature
- fix – Bug fix
- chore – Maintenance, tooling, config updates
- docs – Documentation only
- style – Code formatting (e.g., Prettier), no logic change
- refactor – Code change with no behavior change
- test – Adding or updating tests
- perf – Performance improvements
